In 1990, the federal “Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act” was enacted requiring universities and colleges to:    • Publish and distribute an annual campus security report that contains the most recent calendar year and the two preceding calendar years of campus crime statistics, policy statements and program descriptions, and procedures to be followed in sex offenses.  • Inform prospective students and employees about the report.  • Provide timely notice to the campus on crimes that are considered threats to safety.    The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act required all postsecondary institutions participating in Title IV student financial aid programs to disclose campus crime statistics and security information. The act was amended in 1992, 1998, 2000, 2008, and 2013. The 1998 amendment renamed the law the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime   Statistics Act in memory of a student who was slain in her dorm room in 1986.

This report describes security practices and procedures at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and lists crime statistics for the most recent calendar year and the required two preceding calendar years. Each year the University disseminates information on the status of campus security to all current students and employees.  Upon request, the report is available to persons who request a copy.    The Clery Act requires higher education institutions to give timely warnings of crimes that represent a threat to the safety of students or employees, and to make public their campus security policies. It also requires that crime data be collected, reported, and disseminated to the campus community and are also submitted to the Department of Education. The act is intended to provide students and their families, as higher education consumers, with accurate, complete, and timely information about safety on campus so that they can make informed decisions.

The University of Missouri Kansas City   The University of Missouri-Kansas City was spawned by a city built at the origin of the Oregon and Santa Fe trails. These roadways to the west began at Old Westport, just a few miles from the present UMKC campus.   In the 1890s, there was talk of founding a university in Kansas City because of the city's growth, but it was not until the 1920s that talk turned to action.  In the postwar decade, the chamber of commerce appointed a committee to consider the possibility of a university in Kansas City. A board of trustees comprised of leading businesspersons was established and the board proceeded cautiously with its plans.   In 1929, a charter for the University of Kansas City was granted. The dream became a reality when William Volker, a local philanthropist for whom the 93-acre Volker campus is named, presented the board with the 40-acre nucleus of the present campus site in Kansas City's Rockhill district. Volker also provided funds to purchase the former private home of Walter S. Dickey, a wealthy Kansas City manufacturer. The ivy-covered stone mansion, now known as Scofield Hall and situated in the center of the campus, was the fled",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230552

The ivy-covered stone mansion, now known as Scofield Hall and situated in the center of the campus, was the fledgling university's first main building. With a charter and a campus site, the Board of Trustees started a citywide drive for funds. In 1933, the University of Kansas City announced that classes would begin in October. A faculty of 17 was hired, and on October 2, 1933, 264 students were enrolled. The University of Kansas City, a private, independent university, had begun.   On July 25, 1963, the University of Kansas City became a part of the University of Missouri System, joining three other campuses located in Columbia, Rolla, and St. Louis. At that time, the Board of Trustees of the University of Kansas City transferred assets estimated at $20 million to the Board of Curators of the University of Missouri.   The University's name was changed to University of Missouri-Kansas City and since 1963 the Kansas City campus has experienced steady growth while expanding on urban connections. The total number of students taking classes at UMKC is now more than 16,300 students.   In addition to ",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230553

UMKC officers have the same power and authority as any other police officer in the State. Officers are required to maintain the same skills, training, and qualifications regardless of jurisdiction. In many cases, our officers receive extensive specialized training to better serve the University community.   UMKC employs 25 police officers, seven security officers, and six communications operators. All police officers are graduates of MO POST certified police academies such as the Kansas City Police Academy or the MCC-Blue River Public Safety Institute where they receive more than 600 hours of law enforcement training. The academy training consists of approximately six months of instruction covering Constitutional Law, Missouri Statutory Law, Traffic Law, Criminal Investigation, First Aid, Human Behavior, Juvenile Justice and Procedures, Patrol, Report Writing, Traffic Investigation, Defensive Tactics, Driver Training, Firearms, and Physical Training. Successful completion of the academy is a prerequisite for continued employment.

After completion of the police academy, new officers are further developed in an on-the-job field-training program with a field-training officer as their coach/mentor. Throughout the year, in-service training and other appropriate training using outside agencies and organizations are conducted.

Emergency Response and Evacuation Procedures    The University of Missouri – Kansas City Emergency Operations Plan can be found at  https://www.umkc.edu/alert/EOP_online.pdf. This model emergency response plan has been designed as a strategic plan to provide the administrative procedures necessary to cope with campus emergencies. Any university’s overall ability to respond to an emergency will rely upon tactical plans and business continuity plans developed by its individual departments.  The purpose of any plan is to enable emergency responders and staff to perform essential emergency planning and response functions that will save lives, establish responsibilities necessary to performing these functions; to prevent, minimize and repair damage; and to ensure continuity of operations so that essential services may continue to be provided to the University and its clients.   This plan is intended to be a comprehensive administrative plan for the protection of life and property on this campus. It is compatible with the doctrines and methods expressed in the National Incident Management System (NIMS), the Incident Command System (ICS), the National Response Plan (NRP), Homelan",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230595

It is compatible with the doctrines and methods expressed in the National Incident Management System (NIMS), the Incident Command System (ICS), the National Response Plan (NRP), Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 5 (HSPD-5), Homeland Security Presidential Directive - 8 (HSPD-8), and other similar directives.  Whenever an emergency affecting the University reaches such proportions that it cannot be handled by routine measures the UMKC Chancellor, or designee, may declare a State of Emergency and shall cause implementation of the Emergency Operations Plan by a designated Incident Commander.   The Initial Responses to a Reported Emergency – Each emergency occurring on-campus shall be reported immediately to the UMKC Police at 816-235-1515 or 911. Upon receiving notification of a reported emergency, the UMKC Police shall initiate the following chronology of events: • Dispatch a police officer to the scene. • Dispatch appropriate EMS/Fire services. • Dispatch appropriate facilities management staff. • Contact Chief of Police and the Director of Public Relations. 1.

  UMKCPD will generate an email which will be approved and forwarded by University Public Relations to the University Community as a mass email. Updates to the UMKC community about any particular case resulting in a crime alert may be distributed via mass email or may be shared with The U-News for a follow-up story.    Crime Alerts are filed in the case jacket with the corresponding case report. The department does not issue crime alerts for the above listed crimes if:  1. The department apprehends the subject(s) and the threat of imminent danger for members of the UMKC community has been mitigated by the apprehension.  2.

Policy on Crime and Incident Reporting  The University of Missouri-Kansas City Police Department is the primary agency for reporting and investigating all crimes that occur on University property regardless of how seemingly insignificant the incident. It is the policy of the UMKC Police Department to encourage prompt reporting of crimes, potential criminal actions, and any emergency on campus, including medical and fire emergencies, directly to the UMKC Police if the victim elects to or if the victim is unable to. This includes prompt reporting of all incidents that could result in injury to or death of persons, damage to, destruction, theft, or disappearance of University property (including money and securities) or property of others. These incidents are reported in order that causes may be determined, and corrective measures are taken to improve safety and preserve University assets. Prompt reporting also allows for evaluation of incidents for possible Timely Warnings and inclusion in the annual crime report. Sexual assaults can also be reported to the Title IX Coordinator, KC Atchinson, at (816) 235-6705 or atchinsonk@umkc.edu.    To report a crime or emergency on camp",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230630

Sexual assaults can also be reported to the Title IX Coordinator, KC Atchinson, at (816) 235-6705 or atchinsonk@umkc.edu.    To report a crime or emergency on campus, call UMKC Police at 816-235-1515 or 911 from any campus telephone. Also, emergency phones are distinctively marked and have a blue light on top and are located throughout campus. Campus elevators are also equipped with emergency phones. Upon receipt of the call, a UMKC Police officer will be immediately dispatched to the site to meet with the victim or witness to gather information and prepare an official report and have the authority to make arrests if needed. Response time is based on current activity load and the urgency of the call. Crimes in progress, traffic accidents and medical emergencies have a higher priority than other types of calls.    Crime and incident reports may be made 24 hours a day by calling UMKC Police at 816-235-1515 or 911 or coming to UMKCPD. Priority is given to reports of incidents that threaten life or safety of people, the security of the property and the peace of the community.

UMKCPD is located on the corner of 50th Street and Oak Street, on the bottom level of the Cherry Street Parking Structure and is accessible 24 hours a day.    Each day’s incidents from the previous day are made available on the crime log located in the Lobby of the UMKC Police Department at 5005 Oak Street.

Reporting to Other Campus Security Authorities  “Campus Security Authority” is defined as - An official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including, but not limited to, student housing, student discipline and campus judicial proceedings. An “official” is defined as any person who has the authority and the duty to take action or respond to particular issues on behalf of the institution.

• Any individual or individuals who have responsibility for campus security but who do not constitute a campus police department or a campus security department (e.g., an individual who is responsible for monitoring the entrance into institutional property). Include individuals who provide security at a campus parking kiosk, monitor access into a campus facility, act as event security or escort students around campus after dark.  • Any individual or organization specified in an institution’s statement of campus security policy as an individual or organization to which students and employees should report criminal offenses. If you direct the campus community to report criminal incidents to anyone or any organization in addition to police or security-related personnel, that individual or organization is a Campus Security Authority.  • An official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including, but not limited to, student housing, student discipline and campus judicial proceedings.

An official is defined as any person who has the authority and the duty to take action or respond to particular issues on behalf of the institution.    If someone has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, he or she is a Campus Security Authority.

However, if these individuals are not identified as people to whom crimes should be reported or do not have significant responsibility for student and campus activities, they would not be considered CSAs.    Examples of individuals who would not meet the criteria for being campus security authorities include:  • A faculty member who does not have any responsibility for student and campus activity beyond the classroom.  • Clerical or cafeteria staff.    Note, that because personnel and job positions can change, someone who is a CSA one year might not be a CSA the following year or vice versa.    A Campus Security Authority is not responsible for determining authoritatively whether a crime took place- that is the function of law enforcement personnel. A Campus Security Authority should not try to apprehend the alleged perpetrator of the crime. That too is the responsibility of law enforcement. It is also not a CSA’s responsibility to try to convince a victim to contact law enforcement if the victim chooses not to do so.",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230643

Campus “professional counselors”, when acting as such, are not considered to be a Campus Security Authority, and are not required to report crimes for inclusion into the annual disclosure of crime statistics. As a matter of policy, they are encouraged, if and when they deem it appropriate, to inform persons being counseled of the procedures to report crimes on a voluntary basis for inclusion into the annual crime statistics.    Confidential Reporting Procedures    The University does not have a voluntary confidential reporting system for annual crime statistics. Because police reports are public records under state law, UMKCPD cannot hold reports of crime in confidence. There are some very good reasons, in addition to prosecuting criminal activity, to promptly report crime.   • Timely notification about certain types of crime may affect the safety of others. These crimes include murder, rape, sexual assault, burglary, robbery, motor vehicle theft and arson.  • When you make your report, you assist UMKCPD in maintaining accurate records of the incidence of crime on campus.

This information helps to keep the campus safe by providing the most accurate information on criminal activity to members of the campus community.    The one exception to this is sex offense reports. Pursuant to Revised Missouri Statutes 610.100, a victim of RSMO Chapter 566 (Sex Offenses) may request that his or her identity be kept confidential until a charge relating to such incident is filed. With your permission, UMKCPD can file a report on the details of a sexual assault without revealing your identity. The purpose of a confidential report is to comply with your wish to keep the matter confidential, while taking steps to ensure the future safety of yourself and others. With such information, the University can keep an accurate record of the number of incidents involving students, employees, and visitors; determine where there is a pattern of crime with regard to a particular location, method, or assailant; and alert the campus community to potential danger. Reports filed in this manner are counted and disclosed in the annual crime statistics for the institution.    Confidential r",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230652

• On-line personal electronics registration  • On-line musical instrument registration • On-line bicycle registration       Your  Role in Preventing Crime  A high percentage of campus crimes are incidents of opportunity. Often faculty, staff and students unknowingly contribute to crimes of opportunity by placing themselves or their property at risk. Prevention efforts can be effective in reducing the opportunities for criminal activity. You play a key role in crime prevention efforts. Be cautious and alert to your own safety and protective of your possessions and University property.    In addition to preventing crime, considerable effort is devoted to crime intervention.    Prevention Tips • Do not hesitate to call the police if you feel threatened or confronted. • Keep your residence room, office, and personal spaces locked whenever unattended. • Walk in groups at night—preferably two or more—and remain on well-lit, main walkways. • Know the locations of emergency phones and how to use them. • When parking, secure your vehicle by removing valuables from sight and locking all doors. • Mark valuables with your driver’s license number and record their serial numbers. • Make",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230658

Topics such as personal safety, residence hall security, drug and alcohol abuse awareness and sexual assault prevention are some examples of programs offered during the prior academic year.    All crime prevention and security awareness programs encourage students and employees to be responsible for their own security and the security of others.

Consent to sexual activity requires of all involved persons a conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity. Each person engaged in the sexual activity must have met the legal age of consent. It is the responsibility of each person to ensure they have the consent of all others engaged in the sexual activity. Consent must be obtained at the time of the specific activity and can be withdrawn at any time. Consent, lack of consent or withdrawal of consent may be communicated by words or non-verbal acts.    Someone who is incapacitated cannot consent. Silence or absence of resistance does not establish consent. The existence of a dating relationship or past sexual relations between the Parties involved should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of consent. Further, consent to one form of sexual activity does not imply consent to other forms of sexual activity. Consent to enga",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230739

Further, consent to one form of sexual activity does not imply consent to other forms of sexual activity. Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not imply consent to engage in sexual activity with another. Coercion and force, or threat of either, invalidates consent. (CRR 600.020)   The following is not University policy, but provided for added clarity:    Any sexual act that is initiated upon a person without their consent is against the law and is a violation of UMKC Code of Conduct and UMKC policy. No person shall be subject to any form of retaliation for making a report required by this policy or for making any other good faith report to a Title IX Coordinator.    Consent is two people (or more) deciding together to do the same thing, at the same time, in the same way, with each other. Consent means that you cannot make assumptions about what your partner does or does not want. Absence of the clear communication means that there is no permission to touch someone else. Silence and passivity do not equal consent. Consent to one form of sexual activity does not automatically imply con",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230740

Consent to one form of sexual activity does not automatically imply consent to other forms of sexual activity.   There are circumstances in which even when consent is given, it is not valid. Consent is invalid when given under coercion, intimidation, threat of force; when given by a mentally or physically incapacitated person (e.g., unconscious, too intoxicated to consent, asleep, etc.); or when given by a minor. Continued requests or verbal pressure for sexual activity can be coercive and/or intimidating and may invalidate consent. There is no obligation for an alleged victim to fight off or act in any way to stop a sexual aggressor.   Definitions:",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230741

                 C.  Procedures for Reporting a Complaint  The University has procedures in place that serve to be sensitive to those who report sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking, including written notification to students and employees about their right to file criminal charges as well as the availability of counseling, health, mental health, victim advocacy, legal assistance, visa and immigration assistance and other services on and/or off campus as well as",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230824

additional remedies to prevent contact between a complainant and an accused party, such as housing, academic, transportation and working accommodations, if reasonably available. The University will make such accommodations, if the victim requests them and if they are reasonable available, regardless of whether the victim chooses to report the crime to the UMKC Police or local law enforcement. Students and employees should contact Title IX Coordinator KC Atchinson at 816-235-6705.    UMKC is dedicated to the safety and security of all students, faculty, staff, and visitors. The University strongly encourages students, faculty, staff, and visitors who have been impacted by sexual harassment, sexual violence, interpersonal violence or stalking to use the support services identified and/or pursue criminal and university action. The Title IX Office provides the primary resource for investigations of university sexual harassment and sexual violence complaints and will coordinate as needed with campus police to handle complaints of sexual misconduct, sexual assault, and violence. Sex discrimination may include same-sex, gender identity, and gender expression discrimination.    An",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230832

Sex discrimination may include same-sex, gender identity, and gender expression discrimination.    Any employee of the University who becomes aware of sex discrimination including sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, stalking on the basis of sex, dating/intimate partner violence or sexual exploitation is a Mandated Reporter, regardless of whether the recipient of the behavior is a student, employee, volunteer, or visitor of the University. Exception: Employees with a legal obligation or privilege of confidentiality (including health care providers, counselors, lawyers, and their associated staff) are not considered Mandated Reporters and are not required to report when the information is learned in the course of a confidential communication.    The Title IX Coordinator is regarded as a “Responsible Employee” under Title IX and also a “Campus Security Authority” under the Clery Act.

To file a complaint of sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, or sexual violence/assault, contact the Title IX Coordinator at 816-235-6705 or visit the Title IX Office’s website at http://info.umkc.edu/title9/.      After an incident of sexual assault, domestic violence or dating violence, the victim should consider seeking medical attention as soon as possible at Saint Luke’s Hospital-Plaza, 4401 Wornall Road, Kansas City, MO 64111, 816-932-2000, or University Health hospital, 2301 Holmes, Kansas City, MO 64108, 816-404-1000. In Missouri, evidence may be collected even if you chose not to make a report to law enforcement. Under the Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of 2005, starting in 2009, states must certify that they do not “require a victim of sexual assault to participate in the criminal justice system or cooperate with law enforcement in order to be provided with a forensic medical exam, reimbursement for charges incurred on account of such an exam, or both.” It is important that",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230834

In circumstances of sexual assault, if victims do not opt for forensic evidence collection, health care providers can still treat injuries and take steps to address concerns of pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted disease. Victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, stalking, and dating violence are encouraged to also preserve evidence by saving text messages, instant messages, social networking pages,",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230835

Although the university strongly encourages all members of its community to report violations of this policy to law enforcement, it is the victim’s choice whether or not to make such a report and victims have the right to decline involvement with the police. The University will assist any victim with notifying local police if they so desire. The University of Missouri Kansas City Police Department may also be reached directly by calling 816-235-1515 or in person at 5005 Oak St., Kansas City, MO 64112. Additional information about the University of Missouri-Kansas City Police Department may be found online at: https://www.umkc.edu/police/    If you have been the victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, you should report the incident promptly to the Title IX Coordinator, 5115 Oak, Administrative Center Room 212, Kansas City, MO 64112, 816-235-6705.

Resolution of Complaints  Whether or not criminal charges are filed, the university1 or a person may file a complaint alleging that a student, faculty member or staff member violated the University’s anti-discrimination policies. The rules of procedure governing such complaints can be found at CRR 600.030 Resolution Process for Resolving Complaints of Sexual Harassment under Title IX, CRR 600.040 Equity Resolution Process for Resolving Complaints of Discrimination and Harassment against a Faculty Member or Student or Student Organization and CRR 600.050 Equity Resolution Process for Resolving Complaints of Discrimination and Harassment against a Staff Member or the University of Missouri.

A Complainant may file a Formal Complaint with the Title IX Coordinator in person, by mail, or by electronic mail, by using the contact information set forth in CRR 600.020, or through an online portal provided for this purpose by the University. At the time of filing a Formal Complaint, the Complainant must be participating in or attempting to participate in an education program or activity of the University.  The Title IX Coordinator may sign a Formal Complaint when they believe that with or without the Complainant’s desire to participate in this process, a non-deliberately indifferent response to the allegations requires an investigation. Where the Title IX Coordinator signs a Formal Complaint, the Title IX Coordinator is not a Complainant or otherwise a Party under this policy.

How the University Determines Whether This Policy will be Used Section B. Jurisdiction. Jurisdiction of the University of Missouri under the Title IX policies shall be limited to sexual harassment which occurs in an education program or activity of the University of Missouri against a person in the United States. For purposes of this policy, “education program or activity” includes locations, events, or circumstances over which the University exercised substantial control over both the Respondent and the context in which the conduct occurs, and includes any building owned or controlled by a student organization that is officially recognized by the University. This policy does not apply to sexual harassment which occurs outside of the United States, even when the conduct occurs in an education program or activity of the University.  If a Complainant alleges or the investigation suggests that another University policy violation occurred in concert with an alleged violation of the University’s Title IX policies,",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230884

If a Complainant alleges or the investigation suggests that another University policy violation occurred in concert with an alleged violation of the University’s Title IX policies, the University shall have the authority to investigate and take appropriate action regarding the alleged violations of other University policies pursuant to this process. In conducting such investigations, the Title IX Coordinator(s), and/or their Investigator may consult with and/or seek guidance from the Equity Officer, Student Conduct Coordinator, or other University officials as appropriate. If the allegations in a Formal Complaint that fall under this policy are dismissed, the University may discontinue the process under this policy and proceed under the applicable University procedure for all remaining allegations in the Formal Complaint.  3.

Such evidence regarding either Party’s character is of limited utility and shall not be admitted unless deemed relevant by the decision-maker.  c) Incidents or behaviors of the Respondent not directly related to the possible violation(s) will not be considered unless they show a pattern of related misconduct. History of related misconduct by the Respondent that shows a pattern may be considered only if deemed relevant by the decision-maker.  d) A Party’s records that are made or maintained by a physician, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other recognized professional or paraprofessional acting in the professional’s or paraprofessional’s capacity, or assisting in that capacity, and which are made or maintained in connection with the provision of treatment to the Party, may not be used without that Party’s express consent.  e) The decision-maker shall not require, allow, rely upon, or otherwise use questions or evidence that constit",2026-02-22T23:29:19.230927

In the Administrative Resolution Process, the Respondent and the Complainant may provide a list of questions for the decision-maker to ask the other Party. If those questions are deemed appropriate and relevant, they may be asked on behalf of the requesting Party; answers to such questions will be shared with the requesting Party.   4.

 2. Emergency Removal. The Title IX Coordinator may implement a removal of a Respondent from the University’s education program or activity on an emergency basis, if the Title IX Coordinator, after conducting an individualized safety and risk analysis, determines that an immediate threat to the physical health or safety of any student or other individual arising from the allegations of sexual harassment, justifies removal.  a) In all cases in which an Emergency Removal is imposed, the Respondent will immediately be given notice and an opportunity to challenge the decision of the Title IX Coordinator either prior to such Removal being imposed, or as soon thereafter as reasonably possible but no later than five (5) business days following the Removal.

Advisors. Each Party may have an Advisor of their choice present at the hearing to conduct cross-examination and other questioning for that Party. A Party may not directly question any other Party or any witness; all cross-examination and other questioning on behalf of a Party must be conducted by their Advisor. The Advisor may be, but is not required to be, an attorney. If a Party does not have an Advisor of their choice present at the hearing, the University will provide, without fee or charge to that Party, an Advisor of the University’s choice to conduct cross-examination and other questioning on behalf of that Party. The Parties may not require that the assigned Advisor have specific qualifications such as being an attorney.

If all three (3) requirements for appeal listed in paragraph 4 above are met, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will accept the request for appeal and proceed with rendering a decision on the appeal applying the following additional principles:  a) Appeals are not intended to be full re-hearings of the Formal Complaint and are therefore deferential to the original findings. In most cases, appeals are confined to a review of the written documentation and Record of the Case, and relevant documentation regarding the grounds for appeal. Appeals granted based on new evidence should normally be remanded to the original decision-maker for reconsideration. b) The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will render a written decision on the appeal to all Parties within ten (10) business",2026-02-22T23:29:19.231048

days from accepting the request for appeal. In the event the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer is unable to render a written decision within ten (10) business days from accepting the request for appeal, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will promptly notify the Parties in writing of the delay. c) Once an appeal is decided, the outcome is final. Further appeals are not permitted.  6. Extensions of Time. For good cause, the Equity Resolution Appellate Officer may grant reasonable extensions of time (e.g.: 7-10 business days) to the deadlines in the appeal process. The Equity Resolution Appellate Officer will notify the Parties in writing if such extensions are granted.  When a complainant does not consent to the disclosure of his or her name or other identifiable information to the alleged perpetrator, the university’s ability to respond to the complaint may be limited.

E.  Assistance for Victims: Rights & Options  Regardless of whether a victim elects to pursue a criminal complaint or whether the offense is alleged to have occurred on or off campus, the university will assist victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking and will provide each victim with a written explanation of their rights and options. Such written information will include: • the procedures victims should follow if a crime of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking has occurred;  • information about how the institution will protect the confidentiality of victims and other necessary parties;  • a statement that the institution will provide written notification to students and employees about victim services within the institution and in the community;  • a statement regarding the institution’s provisions about options for, available assistance in, and how to request accommodations and protective measures; and  • an explanation of the procedures for institutional disciplinary action  In Missouri, a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking has the following rights:    Here are crime vict",2026-02-22T23:29:19.231062

  Further, University of Missouri-Kansas City complies with Missouri law in recognizing orders of protection.    Information contained in the order of protection will be entered into the Missouri Uniform Law Enforcement System within 24 hours from the time the order is granted. This information can be accessed by all law enforcement personnel in Missouri.     Orders of protection are valid and enforceable throughout Missouri. Orders of protection issued by other states also must be enforced in Missouri.    Law enforcement officers will attempt to respond immediately to an abuse call when:  • The caller indicates violence is imminent or in progress;  • A protection order is in effect; or  • The caller indicates domestic violence has occurred previously between the parties.    Officers responding to an abuse call will inform the victim of legal actions for relief from adult abuse and of available shelters for victims. They also will arrange transportation to a medical facility or to a place of shelter.    When an officer has probable cause to believe a person has abused someone, he has the authority to immediately arrest the person, even if there is no order of protection.

When an officer has probable cause to believe a person has abused someone, he has the authority to immediately arrest the person, even if there is no order of protection. Officers can make an arrest even if they do not witness the abuse or if the victim refuses to sign an official complaint against the accused abuser.    Also, an officer has the authority to arrest the accused abuser for refusal to surrender custody of children, as may be ordered in an order of protection, and will return the children to the party awarded custody.    If both parties claim to have been assaulted, the officer is not required to arrest both, but is required to try to identify and arrest the person who was the primary physical aggressor.

Punishment   Violating a protective order is a Class A misdemeanor punishable by up to a $1,000 fine and one year in jail. The violation is a Class D felony if the person convicted had been found guilty of violating a protective order within the prior five years. A Class D felony is punishable by up to a $5,000 fine and five years in jail.    Any person who obtains an order of protection from any state should provide a copy to Campus Police and the Office of the Title IX Coordinator. A complainant may then meet with Campus Police and/or UMKC’s victim advocate, RISE Manager Michelle Kroner, to develop a Safety Action Plan, which is a plan for campus police and the victim to reduce risk of harm while on campus or coming and going from campus. This plan may include, but in not limited to: escorts, special parking arrangements, changing classroom location or allowing a student to complete assignments from home, etc. The University cannot apply for a legal order of protection, no contact order or restraining order for a victim from the applicable jurisdiction(s).

The victim is required to apply directly for these services.    Protective orders    Each year thousands of Missourians become victims of domestic violence, a serious crime that can have devastating consequences.    However, help is available to victims of abuse. State law authorizes courts to issue orders of protection to protect victims of abuse and persons threatened with abuse. By issuing these orders, judges can order an accused abuser, for example, to stop abusing, stalking, or harassing a victim and to stay away from the victim’s home.    There are two types of orders of protection:  • An ex parte order, which is a temporary measure quickly issued by the court.  • A full order, which is granted only after a court hearing is held. It is issued for a longer period than the ex parte order.    EX PARTE ORDER OF PROTECTION   If you are a victim of domestic violence, you can go to the circuit court and request an ex parte order of protection against the accused abuser. The accused abuser does not have to be present for you to be granted an order.    An ex parte order may:  • Order the accused abuse",2026-02-22T23:29:19.231080

• Order specific personal property and effects to be turned over to you.  • Order the accused abuser not to communicate with you in any way, including e-mail.    Filing for order  The ex parte order can be obtained from the circuit court in the county:  • Where you and the accused abuser reside,  • Where any abuse took place, or  • Where the accused abuser can be served.    When the circuit court is closed, you may request an ex parte order from any available court in the city or county having jurisdiction.    You do not need a lawyer to obtain the order. Circuit clerks are required under Missouri’s Adult Abuse Act to explain how to file all necessary forms and documents. Some counties have a victim advocate to assist you.    You have the right to request that your address not be disclosed in court documents. You also have the right to be notified when the accused abuser has been served. The circuit clerk will explain how to register for this notification.    The court may immediately issue an ex parte order of protection.

Bystander Intervention  Bystander intervention means safe and positive options that may be carried out by an individual or individuals to prevent harm or intervene when there is a risk of dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, or stalking. Bystander intervention includes recognizing situations of potential harm, understanding institutional structures and cultural conditions that facilitate violence, overcoming barriers to intervening, identifying safe and effective intervention options, and taking action to intervene.  Bystanders play a critical role in the prevention of sexual and relationship violence. They are “individuals who observe violence or witness the conditions that perpetuate violence. They are not directly involved but have the choice to intervene, speak up, or do something about it.”3 We want to promote a culture of community accountability where bystanders are actively engaged in the prevention of violence without causing further harm. We may not always know what to do even if we want to help. Below is a list4 of some ways to be an active bystander. If you or someone else is in immediate danger, dial 911.

Watch out for your friends and fellow students/employees. If you see someone who looks like they could be in trouble or need help, ask if they are ok.  2. Confront people who seclude, hit on, try to make out with, or have sex with people who are incapacitated.  3. Speak up when someone discusses plans to take sexual advantage of another person.  4.

           Risk Reduction Risk reduction refers to strategies designed to decrease opportunities for perpetration, reduce bystander inaction, and increase empowerment for potential victims in order to promote safety and to help individuals and communities address conditions that may facilitate violence. These strategies are not intended to suggest that victims are responsible for being assaulted. The University affirms that only perpetrators are responsible for acts of sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking. The following safety strategies, adapted from the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN) www.rainn.org, are provided to help reduce personal risk of sexual assault or harassment: 1. Stay aware of your surroundings. Knowing where you are and who is around you may help you identify safe options if a situation becomes unsafe. 2. Avoid isolated areas. It is more difficult to seek help if no one is nearby. 3. Walk with purpose. Even if you are uncertain of your destination, act as though you know where you are going. 4. Trust your instincts.

9. Attend social events with friends. Arrive together, check in throughout the evening, and leave together. 10. Go with your instincts. If you feel unsafe or see something suspicious, remove yourself from the situation and contact law enforcement immediately (call 911 in the U.S.). 11. Never leave your drink unattended. If you step away, get a new one. 12. Be cautious about accepting drinks. Only accept drinks from people you trust, watch them being prepared, and carry them yourself. Avoid open, communal containers at parties. 13. Look out for friends. If a friend appears unusually impaired, intoxicated, or out of character, ensure they get to a safe place. 14. Act quickly if you suspect drugging. Call law enforcement immediately (911 in the U.S.), and clearly inform medical professionals so they can conduct appropriate tests (e.g., urine tests). 15. Have strategies for leaving uncomfortable situations: • Remember: The situation is not your fault; responsibility lies with the person causing harm. • Be true to yourself: You never owe anyone an explanation—“I don’t want to” is sufficient. • Use a code word: Agree on a signal with friends or family that indicates you need hel",2026-02-22T23:29:19.231120

UMKC Campus and Emergency Telephone Locations    Blue light emergency telephones (EMER) are located strategically throughout campus. These phones provide the caller a direct line to the UMKC Police. The dispatcher simultaneously receives a display indicating the location of the caller. The elevator telephones (ELEV) work in the same manner. The UMKC Police Department encourages everyone to become familiar with the location of these phones and to report any suspicious activities.  TYPE  LOCATION     TYPE  LOCATION  EMER   Health Sci.

ANNUAL CRIME STATISTICS  The following pages contain crime statistics from past years. The definitions list, following these statistics, was used to determine these crime statistics.    These numbers reflect crimes reported to the UMKC Police Department and numbers reported to the UMKC Police Department by local law enforcement (Kansas City Police Department) and campus security authorities (Student Involvement, Residential Life, and other campus groups).    An institution may withhold, or subsequently remove, a reported crime from its crime statistics in the rare situation where sworn or commissioned law enforcement personnel have fully investigated the reported crime and based on the results of this full investigation and evidence, have made a formal determination that the crime report is false or baseless and therefore “unfounded.” The only entity on campus that can unfound crimes is the UMKC Police Department.    Crimes are recorded in the calendar year they were reported. This report does not use a map to depict its campus, non-campus buildings or property, and public property areas.

 Campus Fire Safety The safety of students and residents is paramount to providing a learning environment at UMKC. Practicing good fire safety is the responsibility of every member of this institution. In our efforts to keep the campus community informed of fire safety procedures and statistics UMKC publishes and distributes an annual fire safety report in conjunction with the Campus Crime Report. To assure inclusion in this report, we encourage students and employees report that a fire occurred to the UMKC Police Department (816-235-1515 or 911) or to Environmental Health and Safety (816-235-5241).

Student Housing Evacuation Procedures In Case of a Fire • If you hear the fire alarm immediately evacuate the building using the nearest available exit. Do not attempt to fight a fire unless you have been trained to do so.  • Awaken any sleeping roommate or suitemates. Prepare to evacuate by putting on shoes and coat if necessary. Feel the doorknob and the door. If they are hot, do not open the door. If they are cool, open slowly, if heat or heavy smoke rushes in, close the door immediately and remain inside.  • When leaving your room, be sure to take your key in case it is necessary to return to the room should conditions in the corridor deteriorate. Make sure to close the door tightly when evacuating.  • Resident life staff members who are present on their floors should facilitate the evacuation of their floor/section if possible. When the alarm sounds shout (Example: there is an emergency in the building leave by the nearest exit) and knock on doors as they make their way to the nearest exit and out the building.  • When exiting in smoky conditions keep your hand on the wall and crawl to the nearest exit.

Always know more than one path out of your location and the number of doors between your room and the exit. • DO NOT USE ELEVATORS. Elevator shafts may fill with smoke, or the power may fail, leaving you trapped. Elevators have features that recall and deactivate the elevator during an alarm. Standing and waiting for an elevator wastes valuable time.  • Each resident should report to their assigned assembly area. Resident life staff should report to their assigned assembly area and make sure that students have cleared the building. Conduct a head count and do not allow re-entry into the building until directed to do so by emergency personnel.

You may not re-enter the building until you receive notification from the local officials or staff.  Procedures Students and Employees Should Follow in Case of a Fire In the event of a fire, the University expects that all campus community members will evacuate by the nearest exit, closing doors and activating the fire alarm system (if one is present) as they leave. Once safely outside a building, it is appropriate to contact 911 and the UMKC Police Department at 816-235-1515. Students and/or staff are informed where to relocate to by staff if circumstance warrants at the time of the alarm. In the event fire alarms sound, University policy is that all occupants must evacuate from the building, closing doors as they leave. No training is provided to students or employees in firefighting or suppression activity as this is inherently dangerous and each community member’s only duty is to exit safely and quickly, shutting doors along the exit path as they go to contain the spread of flames and smoke, and to activate the alarm as they exit. At no time should the closing of doo",2026-02-22T23:29:19.231309

  Fire Reporting Definitions  Cause of fire- The factor or factors that give rise to a fire. The causal factor may be, but is not limited to, the result of an intentional or unintentional action, mechanical failure, or act of nature.    Fire- Any instance of open flame or other burning in a place not intended to contain the burning or in an uncontrolled manner.    Fire drill- A supervised practice of a mandatory evacuation of a building for a fire.    Fire-related injury- Any instance in which a person is injured as a result of a fire, including an injury sustained from a natural or accidental cause, while involved in fire control, attempting rescue, or escaping from the dangers of the fire. The term ‘‘person’’ may include students, employees, visitors, firefighters, or any other individuals.    Fire-related death- Any instance in which a person:  (1) Is killed as a result of a fire, including death resulting from a natural or accidental cause while involved in fire control, attempting rescue, or escaping from the dangers of a fire; or (2) Dies within one year of injuries sustained as a result of the fire.    Fire safety system- Any mechanism or system related to the dete",2026-02-22T23:29:19.231325

Fire safety system- Any mechanism or system related to the detection of a fire, the warning resulting from a fire, or the control of a fire. This may include sprinkler systems or other fire extinguishing systems, fire detection devices, stand-alone smoke alarms, devices that alert one to the presence of a fire, (such as horns, bells, or strobe lights), smoke-control and reduction mechanisms, and fire doors and walls that reduce the spread of a fire.    Value of property damage- The estimated value of the loss of the structure and contents, in terms of the cost of replacement in similar type and quantity. This estimate should include contents damaged by fire, and related damages caused by smoke, water, and overhaul; however, it does not include indirect loss, such as business interruption.

History and Traditions 
If it weren’t for William Volker, a local philanthropist who still had some money left during the 
Great Depression, UMKC might not be here today. The University of Kansas City (or UKC) was 
chartered with the City of Kansas City in 1929, but didn’t have a home until 1930, when Volker 
donated a 40-acre site near 51st and Rockhill Road. UKC opened in the fall of 1933 with 17

called Scofield Hall. In 1963, UKC became a part of the University of Missouri System. 
The idea for having a kangaroo as the mascot for the 
University of Kansas City began more than a year before the 
marsupial actually appeared on the scene. An article, 
“Kangaroo may go to KCU ... Student Editors Believe 
University Should Have a Symbol,” appeared in a September 
1936 edition of The Kansas City Star. Will Mansfield, 
feature writer for the KCU yearbook, was quoted as saying, 
“The Kangaroo would be a good name for the debate 
squad, since there (was) no university athletic 
team.” Interest continued to grow when the Kansas City 
Zoo purchased two baby kangaroos. Soon after, the first 
known drawing of the kangaroo appeared on the cover of",2026-02-22T23:29:21.372648

Open Campus and Time, Place, and Manner Policy 
The “open campus” has long been a traditional policy at UMKC. During formal sessions or in 
informal settings, the entire academic community, students, faculty and staff, have the right to 
hear and express varying viewpoints. 
 
In addition, the freedom to demonstrate in an orderly fashion as a means of presenting views is 
recognized by the University. However, UMKC does not condone demonstrations that interfere 
with the freedom of decision and action of other students or that prevents the free movement of 
students to or from classes, lectures, seminars or employment interviews. When such 
demonstrations occur, the institution and academic community must take action, even if such 
action protects the rights of just one student.

demonstrations are not to be interpreted as infraction",2026-02-22T23:29:21.372660

Freedom of expression is one of the hallmarks of a democratic society. While orderly 
demonstrations are not to be interpreted as infractions of University rules, disorderly 
demonstrations that disrupt the normal life on campus are considered violations. In these cases, 
individuals who are responsible will be subject to the established disciplinary procedures and

students inside the classroom and beyond, without fear that their exercise of such rights will have 
negative repercussions in areas over which the University has responsibility. 
It is equally important that students understand the narrow line separating their First 
Amendment rights and the legal and privacy rights of others so that students can exercise those 
rights within appropriate boundaries. 
Students who believe the conduct of others has crossed this narrow line may choose to report 
this conduct to the Office of Equity & Title IX. Conduct based upon race, color, national origin, 
ancestry, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, and 
protected veteran status, that adversely affects a student’s education, living environment, or 
participation in a University activity, or creates a hostile environment preventing a student from

SI is a peer-assisted study model that improves student learning in courses that are historically 
difficult--in fact, students who regularly attend SI sessions earn a half- to a full-letter grade higher 
than students who do not regularly attend the sessions. 
SI Leaders are students who have successfully taken the course and have been trained in 
cognitive learning techniques. SI sessions are not review sessions, but rather opportunities for 
students to assist each other in mastering cognitive learning techniques.

are permitted for health and religious reasons. Students who exempt themselves from 
immunization for either reason must sign a University of Missouri waiver form (parents must sign

accommodation must contact the ADA Coordinator in the Office of Affirmative Action to make an 
individualized request for an accommodation. The ADA Coordinator will determine, on a case-by-

Determination: 
The determination of whether or not an animal is a service animal is made by asking only the

university policy, students may choose to file a formal complaint with the Office of the Dean of 
Students. This complaint process is not an appeal to re-examine a decision made through a 
University policy nor does it supersede another defined university process. If the student's 
complaint involves discrimination or Title IX issues, the student is referred to the Office of 
Affirmative Action.

Scooter Policy 
UMKC prioritizes the safety of the campus community and the wise use of its resources. The 
increased availability of motorized scooters on or near campus prompts us to issue some 
important guidelines and reminders regarding the use of scooters in our community. 
• Motorized scooters may be ridden or stored safely on city streets that connect to or 
run through campus but are not allowed on UMKC property. (Scooters are defined to 
include self-balancing scooters, battery-operated scooters, hands-free “Segway”-like 
scooters, hoverboards, and electronic scooters, such as “Bird” electric scooters, 
“Lime” electric scooters, etc.) 
• UMKC cares about students and public safety and wants all riders to follow guidelines 
from scooter rental companies, including: Scooter drivers must wear a helmet and be 
at least 18 years old with a valid driver’s license. Scooters are not meant for operation 
on sidewalks. Scooter operators must follow all traffic rule",2026-02-22T23:29:21.372844

at least 18 years old with a valid driver’s license. Scooters are not meant for operation 
on sidewalks. Scooter operators must follow all traffic rules that apply to drivers, 
including obeying street signs and stop signs and not operating under the influence. 
• Electric scooters are not allowed in campus buildings and should be parked or set 
down only on city property adjacent to campus. 
• Students, faculty and staff may not use UMKC electrical outlets to charge “Bird,” 
“Lime” or other electric scooters to receive financial incentives from the companies. 
For students, this policy is in accordance with UMKC Residential Life policy, which 
states that students may not use any residential space for personal financial gain. 
 
In closing, UMKC urges all students, faculty and staff to be aware of their surroundings and on the 
lookout for motorized scooters. Their small size and quiet operation mean they are easy to miss 
in traffic. Scooters are convenient and easy to use, but also expose users to possible injury from 
other vehicles or from other accidents. Our campus community can co-exist with new scooter

1.1  |   Introduction — Brand Overview
The University of Missouri-Kansas City brand is much more 
than a logo or a mascot. The UMKC brand is our reputation 
— who we are as an institution. It is how the public 
identifies with and understands the university’s purpose 
and aspirations. The strength of our brand directly impacts 
the strength of the university. What we say — in print, 
broadcast and online — significantly impacts our image.
THE IMPORTANCE OF THE UMKC BRAND
UMKC competes with academic institutions locally, 
nationally and even internationally. It is increasingly 
important for us to express a single, engaging voice  
in all that we do.
The logo, visuals and language we use in various media  
to describe the university enable us to establish and 
maintain a clear, unified brand identity within the campus, 
the community and beyond.
Brand guidelines have been developed to assist academic 
units, departments, programs, affiliates, constituents, 
vendors and partners in producing materials that are 
consistent and immediately recognizable as UMKC.  
We expect all university partners to use the brand 
consistently. A",2026-02-22T23:29:24.556169
visual-identity-guidelines.pdf,data/visual-identity-guidelines.pdf,pdf,5,2," affiliates, constituents, 
vendors and partners in producing materials that are 
consistent and immediately recognizable as UMKC.  
We expect all university partners to use the brand 
consistently. All uses of the UMKC mark need to be 
reviewed and approved by the UMKC Brand Council  
which can be reached by email at brand@umkc.edu. 
STRENGTHENING THE UNIVERSITY  
BY BUILDING THE BRAND 
The UMKC brand consists of the following guidelines:
• Visual identity  
(logos, marks, fonts, colors, etc.)
• Editorial style
• Web
• Social media
• Kansas City Athletics 
(logos, marks, fonts, colors, etc.)
• Bloch School 
(logos, marks, fonts, colors, etc.)
These brand guidelines were developed to help you 
become a UMKC brand ambassador. In these guidelines, 
you will recognize key brand components, including 
elements of our visual identity and guidelines on how to 
communicate clearly and consistently. Guidelines are 
available to review and download at umkc.edu/brand.

standards, you will help protect the brand identity

with internal and external audiences.
UMKC LOGO UPDATE
In April 2022, the university began using  
a refreshed version of the UMKC logo. 
This updated logo is an evolution of the current mark,  
rather than a redesign, and was developed to solve for  
a few key design challenges. The new logo modernizes  
the font, reduces the scale of the serifs and decreases  
the contrast between thick and thin areas in the letterforms 
in comparison with the old logo. These adjustments help 
to improve readability at smaller sizes, allow for better 
alignment and increase visual weight so that it pairs  
better with other logos.
 
Since this update was a subtle change, rather than a full 
redesign, there is no need to throw away branded items 
and start over. The new logo is being phased in over time 
and should be used on any new print materials being 
created. Digital updates should be ma",2026-02-22T23:29:24.556171

1.2  |   Brand Elements — Brand Color Palette
Our color palette is bold, confident and 
UMKC. Use these colors consistently 
to maintain brand recognition.
COLOR TYPES
• Pantone (PMS) is a standardized 
color matching system, to specify 
and control colors for printing.
• CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) 
is a four-color build for printing.
• RGB (red, green, blue) and HEX 
(hexadecimal) codes are for screens 
and websites. HEX should be used 
over RGB when possible.
• The CMYK, RGB and HEX values 
for UMKC primary colors differ from 
the PMS defaults in most design 
programs. It is necessary to create 
these formulas within your document 
rather than relying on the program’s 
built-in conversion from spot color  
to process color.
GUIDELINES
All pieces should include UMKC Blue  
and Gold as the dominant colors.
Limit the number of secondary colors 
used in a single piece so it does not 
break from the UMKC brand.
Be mindful of color combinations  
that represent other universities.
The UMKC color palette can be 
deployed in various shades and tints 
to help create contrast and variety 
through different pieces of collater",2026-02-22T23:29:24.556185

that represent other universities.
The UMKC color palette can be 
deployed in various shades and tints 
to help create contrast and variety 
through different pieces of collateral. 
Tints of our primary and secondary 
colors are useful when designing 
charts, graphs and diagrams.
Try and use as much contrast  
as possible when using text  
or designs with a colored background. 
For example, UMKC Gold on white  
and white on UMKC Gold have a low 
visual contrast and may be hard  
for people to see and/or read.
White
Note: The breakdown above represents the hierarchical balance of color usage within 
the palette. UMKC Blue and Gold should be the predominant colors, followed by white  
or gray. The remaining colors should be used sparingly and only as accents. The full 
color palette should not be used in one piece, unless in a gradient or for a graph with 
many data points.

1.2  |   Brand Elements — Primary Colors
Like the UMKC logo, our distinctive 
blue and gold colors are a vital visual 
element in the university’s brand. 
Universities around the country are 
identified by their official colors, and 
UMKC is no different.
Variations and inconsistencies in the 
hues dilute the effectiveness of our 
colors and weaken the UMKC brand,  
so it’s important to follow the  
color guidelines.

1.2  |   Brand Elements — Secondary Colors
Our official primary colors  
are UMKC Blue and Gold. 
A supporting color palette was 
designed to complement our primary 
colors. Supporting colors should  
be used as accents within your  
design, but should never become  
the main colors used.
Dark navy and either UMKC Gold 
or dark gold should never be used 
as primary colors together to avoid 
confusion with other university colors.
Orange should only be used in 
connection with the Henry W. Bloch 
School of Management unless using 
the color in a gradient or as an 
additional color in graphs.
Any use of UMKC secondary  
colors or gradients for marketing  
or merchandise purposes requires  
proof review and approval by the 
UMKC Brand Council. Send all 
requests to brand@umkc.edu.

1.2   |   Brand Elements — Gradients
Gradients create visual interest and 
speak to the innovative energy found 
within UMKC’s campus and audience.
Our gradients should be treated  
as a source of light or spatters  
of innovation.
GUIDELINES
Avoid creating gradients that feel dull 
or muted. The tone should feel light 
and bright.
Avoid heavily mixing the primary  
color palette within the gradient.  
These colors should feel like light.
The cooler tones and warmer tones  
in the color palette should be 
separated by white.
When overlaying text on the gradient, 
make sure to keep contrast in mind  
to ensure legibility.
Any use of UMKC secondary  
colors or gradients requires  
review and approval by the  
UMKC Brand Council. Send all 
requests to brand@umkc.edu.

To increase awareness of the 
university’s location or relationship 
to the University of Missouri System, 
upon first reference, you should use 
UMKC’s long-form name: University  
of Missouri-Kansas City.
On second reference, or where UMKC 
already has brand awareness, use the 
abbreviation instead of the long-form 
name. Often, web content uses “our” 
for a more informal tone. 
Any use of UMKC long-form name  
or abbreviation in a graphic 
treatment or on merchandise 
requires proof review and approval 
by the UMKC Brand Council. Send 
all requests to brand@umkc.edu.

2.1  |   Logos, Marks and Graphics — UMKC Logos, Marks and Graphics Overview
Logos, marks and graphics create a strong, 
consistent brand identity. This overview 
defines the UMKC logo options available 
and their intended uses on all materials.
The primary logo is the most important 
element of UMKC’s visual identity and 
should appear on all university materials.
MAIN PRIMARY LOGO
The main primary logo is a single graphic 
element composed of the letters “UMKC” 
with a graphic flame attached to the “K.”
ALTERNATE PRIMARY LOGO
The alternate primary logo is used when 
the audience is not familiar with our UMKC 
abbreviation (i.e. international brochures, 
national ads, etc.) or when the university 
name is not spelled out elsewhere on the 
piece or website. The approved logo is 
made up of two parts: UMKC main primary 
logo and university name.
PRIMARY LOGO  
WITH UNIT SIGNATURE
The primary logo with unit signature is used 
when greater definition is needed beyond 
the UMKC primary logo. The approved 
logo is made up of two parts: UMKC main 
primary logo and the official administrative 
or academic unit, center or institute ",2026-02-22T23:29:24.556225

the UMKC primary logo. The approved 
logo is made up of two parts: UMKC main 
primary logo and the official administrative 
or academic unit, center or institute name.
MASCOT OR ROO MARK
Several versions of the Roo are currently 
associated with UMKC. Each has its own 
unique personality, function and guidelines. 
Any use or modification of a UMKC Roo 
requires review and approval.
CENTER OR INSTITUTE 
LOGO OR MARK
Centers and institutes are organizations that 
have ties, or whose home resides, within the 
university or a unit. Each one has a specific 
logo, which includes the UMKC primary 
logo, center or institute name and unit with 
which it is associated (as applicable).
Unique logos/marks have been created 
in rare instances where exceptions have 
been granted due to the high-profile, 
external-audience focus and competitively 
differentiating nature of a program. A UMKC 
primary logo must also be used on any 
materials featuring these unique logos.

AFFILIATE OR CONSTITUENT  
LOGO OR MARK
Due to their unique relationship with  
UMKC and their focus on external 
audiences, affiliates and constituent 
organizations determine and enforce  
their own brand standards. Materials  
using these unique logos must still include  
either a UMKC primary logo, following  
co-branding guidelines, or contain the 
following statement: “(Affiliate/Constituent 
name) is (an affiliate/a constituent) of the 
University of Missouri-Kansas City.”
A UMKC affiliate is composed of university 
employees who work in partnership with  
the university and may also have an external 
board made up of volunteers. Constituent 
organizations are composed of external 
volunteers advocating on behalf of the 
university. Many of these groups have 
board members who work with a UMKC 
contact and are required to sign an annual 
charter with the university.
There are rare instances when an affiliate  
or constituent uses UMKC’s main primary 
logo with a unique signature, including

UNIVERSITY ORGANIZATION  
OR GROUP LOGO OR MARK
University organizations and groups are 
composed of UMKC students, faculty  
and/or staff. The logo/mark can be unique  
and should contain the university name or 
UMKC letters. Unique logos/marks must  
be preapproved and cannot use official  
UMKC logos or marks.
There are rare instances when a group 
or organization qualifies for an official UMKC 
logo, like the UMKC Staff Council, with 
preapproval from the UMKC Brand Council. 
ATHLETICS LOGO OR MARK
The athletics logos and marks are 
registered/trademarked and licensed  
for Kansas City Athletics and follow their 
own brand standards. No part of the logo  
can be used without permission from 
Kansas City Athletics.

BRANDED GRAPHIC
All branded graphics must be preapproved  
and used in conjunction with a UMKC 
primary logo on all print, digital and 
promotional materials. They cannot be  
used as stand-alone branding or permitted 
on business correspondence and should 
not be close enough in proximity to the

General or unique anniversary graphics  
may be created for use with university-
related anniversaries or anniversary events. 
These will either have a specific event date 
(i.e. conferences, seminars, fundraising 
events) or a fixed start and end date  
(i.e., anniversaries, centennials).

2.1  |   Logos, Marks and Graphics — Logo, Mark or Graphic?
IS IT A LOGO, MARK OR GRAPHIC?
Primary logo versions are the only 
official university logos.
A brand mark is a symbol or image 
that helps instantly identify a specific 
company (i.e., Nike swoosh). The UM 
System Seal, UMKC R1 Seal and 
UMKC Roos are examples of  
approved UMKC marks.
Any combination of design elements 
and text used in marketing materials 
is considered a graphic, not a UMKC 
logo or mark. A graphic may be 
designed for special events and 
programs on occasion.
GUIDELINES
Graphics must be accompanied by  
a version of the primary logo, but the 
graphic and primary logo do not 
need to be in the same imprint area.
MARKETING 
On a multi-page marketing piece,  
the graphic may be on the front cover 
with the primary logo on the back 
cover. On a single-sided marketing 
piece or email, the graphic could go  
in the header with the primary logo 
in the footer.

If a social media avatar includes a

licensed and promotional merchandise,

Main primary logo 
2.2  |   Primary Logo Versions — General University
The logo is the single most important 
visual element of UMKC’s visual 
identity system and should not be 
treated as artwork. It may not be 
modified in any way or attached to 
any other typographic or graphic 
element other than described in these 
guidelines. The primary logo cannot 
be reproduced with a typeface. 
Hand-drawn or scanned versions are 
prohibited. The logo should not be 
modified in any way.
There are three versions of the 
primary logo: Main, alternate  
and with unit signature. A primary 
logo version must appear on all 
visual media.
MAIN PRIMARY LOGO
The main primary logo is composed 
of the letters “UMKC” with a graphic 
flame attached to the letter “K.” The 
primary logo’s flame element reflects 
our ceremonial mace and represents  
the lamp of knowledge.
ALTERNATE PRIMARY LOGO
The alternate primary logo is used 
when the audience is unfamiliar with 
the abbreviation UMKC (i.e., national 
ads, international communications) 
or when the university’s name is not 
spelled out somewhere else.
The approved logo is made up of two 
parts:",2026-02-22T23:29:24.556248

PRIMARY LOGO  
WITH UNIT SIGNATURE
The primary logo with unit signature is 
used when greater definition is needed 
beyond the UMKC primary main or 
alternate logos.
The approved logo is made up of two 
parts: UMKC main primary logo and 
the official administrative, academic 
unit, center or institute name. There is 
both a stacked and horizontal version 
available. Use the format that best 
works for your need.
The primary logo with unit signature  
is approved for the following:
• university administrative unit
• academic unit
• center or institute
The primary logo with unit signature  
for administrative or academic units 
can be used in lieu of the UMKC 
primary logo and must appear on  
all communications produced by  
the university if the UMKC primary  
logo is not used.
The UMKC primary logo with unit 
signature should be used as the main 
logo for UMKC centers and institutes.

and institutes, see section 2.4.

University administrative unit signature
University administrative unit signatures are for offices, divisions and services that are 
central to the university.
Academic unit signature
An academic unit is defined as a college or school of the university.
Note: Academic departments may not create their own logos. They should 
instead use the logo for their parent academic unit.

2.2  |   Primary Logo Versions — Logo Guidelines
Deviations from the visual identity 
standards undermine the integrity  
of the overall brand of UMKC. 
The following guidelines are  
required any time a primary  
logo version is used. 
GUIDELINES
APPROVED COLORS
Pantone 300C and 7405C are the 
official UMKC colors (see section 1.2).  
They should be used whenever 
possible to create an immediate visual 
connection to the university and to 
continue to build brand awareness.
Full-color logos should only be used 
with UMKC colors. The UMKC Blue 
and UMKC Gold version should only 
be placed on white. The white and 
UMKC Gold version can only be placed 
on UMKC Blue. If the background 
color is not white or UMKC Blue,  
the one-color logo should be used.
If your communication piece does 
not contain the official colors, it is 
recommended to use the one-color 
logo in black or the white logo  
on a solid background. 
Do not change the logo to a different 
color (i.e., green, purple, red). A white 
logo on a solid contrasting background 
is preferred over making the logo a 
nonofficial color. The logo should 
never be reproduced",2026-02-22T23:29:24.556257
visual-identity-guidelines.pdf,data/visual-identity-guidelines.pdf,pdf,23,2,"the logo to a different 
color (i.e., green, purple, red). A white 
logo on a solid contrasting background 
is preferred over making the logo a 
nonofficial color. The logo should 
never be reproduced in gold.
VERTICAL CENTER
Primary logos should be centered 
visually, not actually (geometrically), 
when centering vertically. The flame 
element creates the illusion of the logo 
being lower than center when using its 
actual vertical center.
One-color (white, UMKC Blue or black)
If the overall background color is not blue or white, 
like in the green example to the left, then a white or 
black logo should be used. Select the option with 
the most contrast to the background color.

22
2.2  |   Primary Logo Versions — Logo Guidelines continued
The logo should be in a prominent 
place and proportionate to the item on 
which it is being used. A logo too big 
or too small loses its effectiveness as 
a brand identifier. Placing any element 
too close to a primary logo diminishes 
its importance. 
SAFE SPACE
The minimum space needed around  
a primary logo version should be equal  
to half the height of the logo’s U  
from all edges, text and other  
graphic elements.
MINIMUM SIZE
The minimum width of the main 
primary logo in all primary logo 
versions is one inch. 
There will be instances when a smaller 
logo size is acceptable, including 
print and web ads and promotional 
products. For these instances, it is 
recommended to use the main primary 
logo, without the university name or 
unit signature.
As illustrated, the safe space on each side of the logo should 
be equal to or greater than half the height of the capital letter 
“U” in the UMKC logo. This safe space also applies to graphic 
elements in the document and page edges.

2.3  |   Mascot and Roo Marks — Roo Overview
Since the 1930s, the UMKC Roo has 
been an integral part of our visual 
identity. Through dramatic changes 
in height, weight, color and attitude, 
the Roo has transformed from a 
playful cartoon character to a powerful 
mascot representing our sporting 
teams. Our furry friend has never lost 
the pride and pleasure of being one 
of a few kangaroos currently atop the 
collegiate mascot mountain. The Roo 
has entertained generations of UMKC 
fans and their friends and families, as 
well as countless, undoubtedly envious 
mascot rivals.
Several versions of the Roo are 
currently associated with UMKC. 
Each has its own unique personality, 
function and guidelines.
Any use or modification of a UMKC 
Roo, including Roos not listed in 
these guidelines, requires review 
and approval by the UMKC Brand 
Council. Send all requests to  
brand@umkc.edu.
For additional information  
about use of the mascot, see

2.3  |   Mascot and Roo Marks — Roo Evolution
UMKC’s history with the Roo began  
in 1936. The then University of Kansas 
City was just three years old, and the 
school’s debate team was in search of 
a mascot before joining competitions.
Across town, anticipation was building 
for the Kansas City Zoo’s pregnant 
kangaroo and the arrival of her twins. 
This inspired the students to chose the 
kangaroo, believing the mascot would 
stand out, and it even rhymed with the 
school’s nickname, KCU. In the fall of 
1937, Kasey Kangaroo was born. 
Shortly after, a group of students  
wrote to a Kansas City native,  
and up-and-coming animator,  
asking for a design for the March  
1938 edition of the student-published 
humor magazine, The Kangaroo.  
The animator, Walt Disney, answered 
with a drawing of Kasey Kangaroo 
shaking hands with Mickey Mouse.
Over the next couple of decades, 
students created their own version  
of the Roo for various purposes.  
In 1963, the Roo was officially adopted 
by then University of Kansas City. 
Today, the Roo forms an integral  
part of UMKC’s identity.

2.3  |   Mascot and Roo Marks — Classic Roo
The Classic Roo mark is an adaptation  
of the historical Kasey the Kangaroo. 
It is available for staff, faculty and 
students to use for university-related

it be combined with words to create 
another logo or graphic mark.
The Classic Roo mark cannot be 
modified in any way, have any 
elements added to it or be used  
to create a pattern without approval 
from the UMKC Brand Council.
The Classic Roo mark cannot be

SAFE SPACE
The minimum space needed around  
the Classic Roo mark should be equal  
to the width of the Roo’s front paw  
from all edges, text and other  
graphic elements.
MINIMUM SIZE
The minimum height of the full-color  
or one-color Classic Roo mark  
is one inch. The minimum height  
of the reversed Classic Roo mark  
is one-and-a-half inches.
BOTTOM ALIGNMENT 
Text and other graphics should be 
aligned visually with the Classic Roo 
mark, not actually (geometrically), 
when aligning from the bottom. The tail 
creates the illusion of the mark floating 
above the other element when using 
its actual bottom alignment. For best 
results, align with the bottom of the 
front foot instead.

2.4  |   Other Logos and Marks — Affiliates and Constituents
Due to their unique relationship with 
UMKC and their focus on external 
audiences, affiliates and constituents 
determine and enforce their own brand 
standards. 
AFFILIATES
A UMKC affiliate is composed  
of university employees who work  
in partnership with the university  
and may also have an external board 
made up of volunteers.
CONSTITUENTS
Constituents are composed of external 
volunteers advocating on behalf of 
the university. Many of these groups 
have board members who work with a 
UMKC contact and are required to sign 
a yearly charter with the university.
GUIDELINES
Materials using these unique logos 
must still include either a UMKC 
primary logo, following co-branding 
guidelines, or contain the following 
statement in 6-point type or larger: 
“(Affiliate/Constituent name) is an 
affiliate/constituent of the University  
of Missouri-Kansas City.”

leaders to support the betterment  
of the university as a whole rather  
than a specific group associated  
with an academic unit.

and the UMKC Brand Council before 
it can be used.

The main primary seal mark is 
composed of the letters “R1” with  
the phrase “Top Tier University""

be included on your piece due to 
space restrictions, etc.
SIMPLE SEAL
The simple seal mark is used when the 
primary or alternate seals will not be 
legible due to size restrictions, etc.
A primary UMKC logo version must 
appear on all visual media using

APPROVED COLORS
Pantone 300C and 7405C are the 
official UMKC colors (see section 1.2).  
They should be used whenever 
possible to create an immediate visual 
connection to the university and to 
continue to build brand awareness.
Full-color seal marks should only be 
used with UMKC colors and should 
only be placed on a white or UMKC 
Blue background or photo. Otherwise, 
the one-color seal should be used. 
Select the option with the most 
contrast to the background color. 
If your communication piece does 
not contain the official colors, it is 
recommended to use the one-color 
seal mark in black or white. 
Do not change the seal mark to a 
different color (i.e., green, purple, 
red). The text on the seal mark should 
always be the darkest color. If using 
the one-color seal mark on a light 
background, use the blue or black 
version. White or yellow one-color 
(reversed) versions should be used  
on darker backgrounds.

2.5  |   Branded Graphics — Graphics Overview
Unique graphics may be created  
for use by the university or a unit  
for university-related events.
UNIT, CENTER OR INSTITUTE 
NON-DEGREE PROGRAMS
Programs within a unit, center or 
institute will not have an official UMKC 
logo. They can have a unique text/
graphic treatment. 
GUIDELINES
All branded graphics must 
be preapproved and used in 
conjunction with a UMKC primary 
logo on all print, digital and 
promotional materials. They cannot 
be used as stand-alone branding 
and are not permitted on business 
correspondence. 
Graphics should not be close enough 
in proximity to the primary logo or 
university name to suggest that these 
two separate items constitute a new 
logo. If you are limited on space to use 
an official logo, then you should use 
the university name spelled out. If the 
former doesn’t fit, you can use UMKC.
Anniversary graphics may not be  
used longer than one year, except  
in the case of centennial celebrations. 
Those may be used up to one year 
before and after a centennial date.

GUIDELINES
Anniversary graphics must be

3.1  |   Introduction —  Using UMKC Logos, Marks, Graphics and Other Brand Elements
The UMKC brand is everywhere — 
which is just how we like it. Applying 
the brand consistently and powerfully 
across a variety of channels, products, 
marketing materials and customer-
facing touchpoints can help customers 
get to know a brand, create trust and 
strengthen the brand. 
This section provides information 
about implementing the UMKC Brand 
Guidelines for your print or digital 
project. While there is flexibility to 
some of these examples, it is important 
to note the value of consistency and 
connecting to the university brand in 
appropriate ways. You can find more 
templates and ways to apply the brand 
at umkc.edu/mcom.

3.2  |  Co-Branding with a Primary Logo —  Multiple Primary Logos
There are many instances when  
UMKC academic units, services, 
organizations and administrative 
offices partner with each other.  
The following information details  
how to represent the UMKC logo  
with other internal partners.
GUIDELINES
When co-branding with other UMKC 
partners, set each partnering entity  
in Helvetica Neue Bold Condensed 
type rather than repeating multiple 
UMKC primary logos. 
Always pair the partner grouping  
with the UMKC main primary logo. 
Co-branded logos must follow the 
same guidelines as the UMKC primary 
logos. Further information can be 
found in section 2.2.
Do not include multiple partner names 
in a return address. Instead, use 
University of Missouri-Kansas City  
and pick one office location to list in 
the return address (if not mailing bulk).

3.2  |  Co-Branding with a Primary Logo —  Primary Logo with Non-Primary Logo
There are many instances when the 
university will partner with an affiliate 
or constituent group, affiliate hospital 
or external organization. The following 
information details how to represent 
the UMKC primary logo with other 
partner (non-UMKC) logos.
HIERARCHY
Logo hierarchy varies and 
is determined by the type of 
partner relationship established. 
Considerations such as financial 
contribution, degree of sponsorship 
offered, location of event or 
partnership, and who is leading 
the partnership will determine the 
placement of the logos.
Whichever partner leads will  
determine the appropriate  
co-branding logo treatment.
Logos must maintain an equal visual 
proportion in relation to one another.
GUIDELINES
In some instances, the UMKC alternate 
primary logo or primary logo with 
unite signature can be substituted for 
the UMKC main primary logo. If the 
application size does not allow for 
legibility (less than one inch wide),  
then the UMKC main primary logo 
should be used.
Co-branded logos must follow the 
same guidelines as the U",2026-02-22T23:29:24.556390
visual-identity-guidelines.pdf,data/visual-identity-guidelines.pdf,pdf,56,2,"y logo. If the 
application size does not allow for 
legibility (less than one inch wide),  
then the UMKC main primary logo 
should be used.
Co-branded logos must follow the 
same guidelines as the UMKC primary 
logos. Further information can be 
found in section 2.2.
Please adhere to any guidelines 
regarding the other partner’s brand.
No party may use the UMKC name 
or primary logo without permission 
from the UMKC Brand Council.  
Send all requests for co-branding  
to brand@umkc.edu.
UMKC as an equal partner
When UMKC is an equal partner with an affiliate or constituent group, affiliate hospital or 
external organization, the UMKC primary logo should be separated from the other logo(s)  
by a vertical rule with a minimum of the logo safe space between the vertical rule and logos.
UMKC as the primary partner
When UMKC is the primary partner, the UMKC primary logo can be accompanied by the 
partner logo(s) or text. The vertical rule is not required when using multiple partner logos,  
but a minimum of the logo safe space should be maintained between the UMKC primary  
logo and the partner name(s) or logo(s).
UMKC as a supporting partner
When UMKC is a supporting partner, the UMK",2026-02-22T23:29:24.556391

but a minimum of the logo safe space should be maintained between the UMKC primary

UMKC as a supporting partner
When UMKC is a supporting partner, the UMKC primary logo should appear with other 
supporting partner logos somewhere on printed materials and websites. The vertical rule  
is not required, but a minimum of the logo safe space should be maintained.

3.2  |  Co-Branding with a Primary Logo —  Primary Logo with Roo Mascot Mark
In some rare instances, it may be 
necessary to co-brand Kansas City 
Athletics with UMKC academics. 
Kansas City Athletics maintains an 
entire suite of graphics, including Roo 
Mascot marks. For more information 
about Athletics branding, refer to their 
brand guidelines, available at  
umkc.edu/mcom.
GUIDELINES
The Roo Mascot mark is the only 
Kansas City Athletics branding allowed 
to be used with UMKC branding.  
Other logos and marks must never  
be used. 
If space allows, a UMKC primary  
logo should always be used when  
co-branding. If not, “UMKC” letters 
must be included.
The Roo Mascot mark and primary 
logo should have sufficient space 
between them so as not appear to be 
one logo. For instance, on a multi-page 
marketing piece, the Roo Mascot mark 
may be on the front cover with the 
primary logo on the back cover. On a 
single-sided marketing piece or email, 
the primary logo could go in the header 
with the mark towards the bottom. 
The Roo Mascot mark cannot be used 
for any for-profit use without going 
through CLC. For more infor",2026-02-22T23:29:24.556397

the primary logo could go in the header 
with the mark towards the bottom. 
The Roo Mascot mark cannot be used 
for any for-profit use without going 
through CLC. For more information  
about licensing the Roo Mascot mark, 
contact Athletics@umkc.edu.
All usage of the Roo Mascot  
mark must be approved by  
Kansas City Athletics before  
internal or external use.
If you would like to incorporate  
the Roo Mascot mark into your 
materials, submit a pdf or jpeg of 
your layout to Athletics@umkc.edu for 
approval. Any uses beyond student-
focused materials must be also 
approved by the UMKC Brand Council 
at brand@umkc.edu.
